# flask-project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate automated deployment for a basic application environment consisting of the Python Flask web framework with a MySQL backend and Nginx for a load balancer. The automated setup also includes Prometheus monitoring.

Use git clone 

and start set-environment.sh, which will do the whole work for you.

Once it is finished, validate the application through your browser with http://<your-ip> Â and Prometheus http:// <your-ip>:9090/targets or FQDN.
